# tkinter-workout-gui
I created a GUI titled "I Need a Pump" with Python and Tkinter to break the monotony of my day to day workout routines. I made buttons that randomize a list of my favorite exercises separated by muscle groups. When you push a button, the outcome is three exercises (or options) you can incorporate into the workout. 

I also created separate pages to break the week into two phases. This is because I like to work out for three days in a row with a day of rest in between. This allows me to target certain areas in my chest, shoulders, back, and legs, for the first three days, and different areas in those same muscle groups the next three days.

*This is a work in progress*
